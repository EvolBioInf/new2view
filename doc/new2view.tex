\section{Introduction}
The program \texttt{new2view} draws phylogenetic trees specified in
the ``Newick'' format. This is a human-readable notation for
phylogenetic trees; a tree with tree taxa, $A$, $B$, and $C$, is
written like this
\begin{center}
\texttt{((A,B),C);}
\end{center}
The leaves are denoted by their labels, while internal nodes are
denoted by round brackets; the root node is followed by a
semi-colon. When drawn with \texttt{new2view} it looks like in
Figure~\ref{fig:phy}A. This tree contains no explicit branch lengths,
so all branches are drawn with length 1. Branch lengths can be added
by writing a colon to the right of a node marker, followed by the
distance from that node to its parent, for example,
\begin{center}
  \texttt{((A:0.2,B:0.25):1,C:1.2);}
\end{center}
\texttt{New2view} converts this to Figure~\ref{fig:phy}B.

In addition to distances, individual nodes can also be labeled, for
example with support values. Say the parent node of $A$ and $B$ in our
example tree has support value 98, then we write this in square
brackets behind the node marker
\begin{center}
  \texttt{((A:0.2,B:0.25)[98]:1,C:1.2);}
\end{center}
which \texttt{new2view} converts to Figure~\ref{fig:phy}C.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \textbf{A} & \textbf{B} & \textbf{C}\\
\texttt{((A,B),C);} & \texttt{((A:0.2,B:0.25):1,C:1.2);} & \texttt{((A:0.2,B:0.25)[98]:1,C:1.2);}\\\\
\input{test1} & \input{test2} & \input{test3}
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Three example trees drawn with
    \texttt{new2view}. (\textbf{A}) has no explicit branch lengths, while
    (\textbf{B}) does have them; (\textbf{C}) differs from
    (\textbf{B}) by the addition of the support value \emph{98}.}\label{fig:phy}

\section{Getting Started}
The program \texttt{new2view} was written in C on a computer running Linux.
Please contact \texttt{\input{email}} if there are any problems
with the program.
\begin{itemize}
\item Obtain the package\\
\texttt{git clone https://www.github.com/\input{repo}/new2view}
\item Change into the directory just downloaded
\begin{verbatim}
cd new2view
\end{verbatim}
and make \texttt{new2view}
\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}
\item Test \texttt{new2view}
\begin{verbatim}
make test
\end{verbatim}
\item The executable \texttt{new2view} is located in the
  directory \texttt{build}. Place it into your \texttt{PATH}.
\item Make the documentation
\begin{verbatim}
make doc
\end{verbatim}
This calls the typesetting program \texttt{latex}, so please make sure
it is installed before making the documentation. The typeset manual is
located in
\begin{verbatim}
doc/new2view.pdf
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\section{Change Log}
Please use
\begin{verbatim}
git log
\end{verbatim}
to list the change history.
